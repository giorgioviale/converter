# converter

simple program for convering units of measure (no GUI) written in Rust.
## hot to run:

```
cargo build Cargo.toml
```
and then execution via terminal.


_right now only working with celsius and fahrenheit; ideally the compatibility will be eventually extended with time_

ps: the project is at the very beginning, and as a very amateur programmer in rust (and in general),
juvenile errors are to be expected, bear with me and interact if you feel like to help improving with little
hobby of mine.

### peace :P
